4. **Brief Improvement Suggestions:**
   - **Error Handling:** Review and possibly enhance the error messaging for status code 400 to provide clearer guidance to clients on why requests are failing. This can help clients adjust their requests appropriately.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Investigate the backend processes and server configurations contributing to the high variability in response times. Optimizing database queries, increasing server resources, or implementing load balancing might be beneficial.
   - **Monitoring and Logs:** Enhance monitoring to pinpoint the exact cause of high response times and frequent errors. Detailed logs should help in understanding whether the issues are more related to specific times of day, certain types of requests, or other patterns.
   - **Client Education:** Ensure that there is comprehensive documentation available for clients on how to properly form requests and what each endpoint expects in terms of parameters and payload structure.

Improving these areas should help stabilize the API's performance and reduce the frequency of client errors.
