LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows. For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.

First, I need to list all the Java files in the specified directory to understand the scope of files I will be working with.

Action: ListJavaFiles
Action Input: C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\osif-java-cg-candidate
Observation: [FOUND] 6 Java files.
Thought:Now that I know there are 6 Java files, I need to extract information from each file to understand their class types and other details.

Action: ExtractCodeInfo
Action Input: C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\osif-java-cg-candidate
C:\Users\rdamera\AppData\Local\Temp\ipykernel_50544\3796873581.py:63: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `LLMChain` was deprecated in LangChain 0.1.17 and will be removed in 1.0. Use :meth:`~RunnableSequence, e.g., `prompt | llm`` instead.
  chain = LLMChain(llm=get_openai_client(), prompt=prompt)

Observation: [SUCCESS] Parsed 6 files.
Thought:With the class information extracted, I can now generate JUnit 5 test classes for each Java file, using appropriate frameworks like Mockito or WebMvcTest based on the class type.

Action: GenerateJUnitTests
Action Input: C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\osif-java-cg-candidate
Observation: [SUCCESS] Generated 6 test classes.
Thought:Now that the test classes have been generated, the final step is to save these test files into a `generated_tests` directory under the matching package structure.

Action: SaveJUnitTests
Action Input: C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\osif-java-cg-candidate\generated_tests
Observation: [SUCCESS] Saved 6 test files.
Thought:All steps have been successfully completed. The Java files were listed, analyzed, JUnit test classes were generated, and finally, these test files were saved in the specified directory.

Final Answer: All Java files under the directory C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\osif-java-cg-candidate have been processed to generate and save JUnit 5 test classes in the `generated_tests` directory as per the specified package structure.

> Finished chain.

âœ… Final Result: All Java files under the directory C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\osif-java-cg-candidate have been processed to generate and save JUnit 5 test classes in the `generated_tests` directory as per the specified package structure.
