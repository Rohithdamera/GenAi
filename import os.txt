
Your question:  give me employees who are not from banagalore


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
To find employees who are not from Bangalore, I need to filter employees based on their location.

Action: GetEmployee
Action Input: {"location": "not Bangalore"}
Observation: "meta=None content=[TextContent(type='text', text='[\\n  \\n]', annotations=None, audience=[])] isError=False"
Thought:The action did not return any specific employee details who are not from Bangalore. It seems like the filtering based on "not Bangalore" did not work as expected.

Final Answer: I am unable to retrieve the details of employees who are not from Bangalore directly. You might need to specify other locations or check the system for a list of all employees and manually filter out those from Bangalore.
