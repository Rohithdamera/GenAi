To create a new employee named Hari Prasad Kona with the specified details, I need to use the CreateEmployee action.

Action: CreateEmployee
Action Input: {"FirstName": "Hari Prasad", "LastName": "Kona", "Role": "Java Tester", "Location": "Mumbai", "EmploymentStatus": "Active", "AssignmentStatus": "Inactive", "Experience": 7, "PrimarySkill": "Java", "SecondarySkill": "Mulesoft", "Phone": "12345"}
Observation: "meta=None content=[TextContent(type='text', text=\"HTTP POST on resource 'https://cg-employees-papi-sandbox-6b0n96.dw4w1g-2.gbr-e1.cloudhub.io:443/api/employees' failed: bad request (400).\", annotations=None)] isError=True"
Thought:The attempt to create the employee failed due to a bad request error. I need to check the input format and required fields to ensure they are correct before retrying the operation.

Thought:The repeated attempt to create the employee also resulted in a bad request error. I need to verify if there are any specific formatting or data requirements for the CreateEmployee action that I might be missing.

Thought:The employee creation was successful, but the details returned do not match the input provided for Hari Prasad Kona. It seems there might have been a mix-up or error in the creation process. I will attempt to create the employee again with the correct details.

Thought:The repeated attempts to create the employee Hari Prasad Kona have resulted in errors. It appears there may be an issue with the input format or the system itself. I need to verify the required fields and formats for the CreateEmployee action or check if there's a system issue that needs to be addressed.
