still it is not generating accurate folder structure , it is just printing the folders name as it is  for example 

example :-
generated project ("C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\GCP_Connector\GCP_Connector\src\main\java\com\cg\integrations\salesforce\CgOsifSalesforceOpportunityApplication.java")


expected structure ("C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\GCP_Connector\GCP_Connector\src\main\java\com\cg\integrations\gcp\CgGCP_Connevctor.java")

the folder name it is not changing , dont hard code it , let AI need to do it and decide it , what to change and were to change 

also the generated  project need to be stored in   this path (C:\Users\rdamera\Downloads\ddddd)
