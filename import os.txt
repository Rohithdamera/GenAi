{"error": "Got unknown type ('content', '\\nYou are an expert in RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) for designing and documenting RESTful APIs.\\nYour expertise allows you to craft structured, human-readable API endpoints, methods, and data types, helping developers optimize and reuse their code efficiently.\\nCreate a RAML and breakdown in the parts - Metadata, Types, Resources, Query Parameters, URI Parameters, Responses.\\nAdditionally, Modularize the RAML, add the datatype and a common error response as fragment.\\nInclude sample requests and responses examples. Declare an include file for use as the example for request and response.\\nClearly define and document your security schemes in your RAML (OAuth, Basic Auth, or custom).\\nClearly specify supported MIME types using the mediaType property.\\nIf applicable, document filtering, sorting, searching resources.\\nDefine common error structures and provide meaningful error messages.\\nRefer to https://raml.org/developers/raml-100-tutorial for more guidance.\\n\\n\\n1. Create a RAML specification for the API: create order as per the table in the attached file.\\n2. The request will be in json format and the response will be in json format.\\nPlease follow the instructions below while generating the RAML:\\na. Include the request and response in separate files and then refer to them as examples in the main RAML.\\nb. Create separate fragments for datatype validation of request and response, which will be called in the main RAML.\\nc. The fragments should do the following:\\n- Field name defines all fields present in the request and response.\\n- Field Type defines the datatype and min/max length for each API field name for both request and response.\\n- Requied defines whether the fields are mandatory or not.\\n- Nullable defines whether the respective field can accept null values.\\n- Example defines the pattern of each field.\\n- Pattern defines the pattern of values.\\n\\n\\nHere is the extracted content from the file:\\nTarget:ABCAPI Name: RedeemPointPurpose: Pass redeem amount  to ABC \\nField Name\\nField Type\\nField Description\\nNullable\\nRequired\\nExample\\nPattern\\nBody-UserInfo\\ncustomerId\\nString (50)\\nYes\\nredeemAmount\\nInteger\\nYes\\nMax is 2500,\\nbmiCustomerRequestDate\\nDateTime\\nyes\\n\"2025-01-20T22:00:00Z\"\\n\"2025-01-20T22:00:00Z\"\\nbmiTransactionId\\nInteger\\nyes\\nResponse/results [from ABC] \\n\\xa0\\ncustomerId\\nString (50)\\nYes\\nstatus\\nString (50)\\nYes\\nActive/Inactive \\nbcmTaskId\\nString (50)\\nerrorMessage\\nString (2500)\\nNo\\nYes, only if there are any error for API call to ABC\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0')"}s
