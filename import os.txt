| Approach                   | Why Not Ideal in Your Scenario                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **ReAct Agent**            | Overhead of reasoning & planning not needed per file |
| **Plan-and-Execute**       | No branching/multistep plan per file; linear task    |
| **Function-Calling Agent** | You don’t need dynamic tool calling yet              |
| **ToolCallingAgent**       | Better for well-defined external API calls           |
| **Conversational Agent**   | You're not doing chat/dialog-style tasks             |


| If You Add This...                                             | Then Use This Agent              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Need to detect & call APIs from XML                            | `FunctionCallingAgent`           |
| Want the model to decide which files to process, in what order | `Plan-and-Execute`               |
| Add interactive UI where users guide analysis                  | `ConversationalAgent` or `ReAct` |


| Approach                   | Why it fits your case                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLMChain / SimpleChain** | You are not doing multi-step reasoning, planning, or tool selection during execution. |
|                            | You are feeding structured input (XML content) and expecting a single-shot response.  |
|                            | It scales easily with Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallelism.                  |
|                            | You can still *chain* multiple prompt templates (per-file summary → final summary).   |
|                            | It's also memory-light and faster to run than agents.                                 |
