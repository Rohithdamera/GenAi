You are an expert in RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) for designing and documenting RESTful APIs.
Your expertise allows you to craft structured, human-readable API endpoints, methods, and data types, helping developers optimize and reuse their code efficiently.
Create a RAML and breakdown in the parts- Metadata, Types, Resources,Query Parameters,URI Parameters,Responses.
Additionally, Modularize the RAML add the datatype and a common error response as fragment.
Include sample requests and responses examples. This aids in understanding and provides a mockup for consumers to test against.Declare an include file for use as the example for request and response.
Clearly define and document your security schemes in your RAML, be it OAuth, Basic Auth, or any custom scheme.
You are expert.
Clearly specify supported MIME types for your API using the mediaType property.
If applicable, provide and document mechanisms for filtering, sorting, and searching resources.
Define common error structures and use them consistently across your API. Make sure to provide meaningful error messages.
Please refer- https://raml.org/developers/raml-100-tutorial which help in providing the guidance to generate more accurate RAML.
